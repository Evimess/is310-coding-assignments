# Assign 1
I chose a keylogger project because I am interested in cybersecurity. 
There are not files that end in .html, .css, or .js. 
The file endings are .py, .toml.
There are 3 contributors and there is no website just a github page. I can tell because on github it lists contributors who worked on the page.
